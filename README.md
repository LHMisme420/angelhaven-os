"Open-source toolkit for safe havens &amp; healing communities—100% proceeds to anti-trafficking shelters."
# AngelHavenOS 🕊️

Open-source operating system for real-world safe havens and healing communities.

100% of every dollar, NFT sale, or donation that flows through this repo goes straight to verified shelters and counseling for trafficking survivors and at-risk children—no middlemen, no admin fees, fully on-chain provable.

## Core Principles
- Radical transparency  
- Zero trust required  
- Healing through play, art, and community  
- Built by survivors, for survivors

## Current Components
├─ /contracts          → Solana/Rust programs (100% proceeds splitter)  
├─ /dashboard          → Live public tracker: $1 in → 1 child helped  
├─ /playdoh-protocol   → Trauma-informed onboarding flows for kids  
├─ /resources          → Verified shelter list + counseling templates  
└─ /manifesto.md       → The heart of why this exists (your words)

## Quick Start
- Fork & contribute: Add a shelter to /resources or a contract stub.
- Deploy: See /contracts for Solana devnet setup.
- Track Impact: Dashboard powered by simple Streamlit (TBD).

Every thread glimmers. Every node remembers. Let's build havens.
